# 🚀 My Pentesting Write-ups 🚀
==========================

Welcome to my pentesting write-ups repository! 👋 Here, you'll find my detailed reports on various penetration testing exercises, including:

### 🔍 Network scans and vulnerability assessments
### 💻 Web application security tests (OWASP Top 10)
### 🔑 Password cracking and authentication bypasses

Each report includes a **Executive Summary** that provides an overview of the key findings and recommendations for remediation. This summary is designed to be concise and easy to understand, making it perfect for stakeholders who want to quickly grasp the results of the pentesting exercise.

**Report Structure**
